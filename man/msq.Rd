\title{75 mood items from the Motivational State Questionnaire for 3896 participants}
\description{Emotions may be described either as discrete emotions or in dimensional terms.  The Motivational State Questionnaire (MSQ) was developed to study emotions in laboratory and field settings.  The data can be well described in terms of a two dimensional solution of energy vs tiredness and tension versus calmness.  Additional items include what time of day the data were collected and a few personality questionnaire scores.

\details{The Motivational States Questionnaire (MSQ) is composed of 72 items, which represent the full affective range (Revelle & Anderson, 1998). The MSQ consists of 20 items taken from the Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List (Thayer, 1986), 18 from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS, Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) along with the items used by Larsen and Diener (1992). The response format was a four-point scale that corresponds to Russell and Carroll's (1999) "ambiguous--likely-unipolar format" and that asks the respondents to indicate their current standing (``at this moment") with the following rating scale:\cr
0----------------1----------------2----------------3
\cr
Not at all		A little		Moderately     	Very much \cr

The original version of the MSQ included 72 items. Intermediate analyses (done with 1840 subjects) demonstrated a concentration of items in some sections of the two dimensional space, and a paucity of items in others. To begin correcting this, 3 items from redundantly measured sections (alone, kindly, scornful) were removed, and 5 new ones (anxious, cheerful, idle, inactive, and tranquil) were added.  Thus, the correlation matrix is missing the correlations between items anxious, cheerful, idle, inactive, and tranquil with alone, kindly, and scornful. 

Procedure. The data were collected over nine years, as part of a series of studies examining the effects of personality and situational factors on motivational state and subsequent cognitive performance. In each of 38 studies, prior to any manipulation of motivational state, participants signed a consent form and filled out the MSQ. (The procedures of the individual studies are irrelevant to this data set and could not affect the responses to the MSQ, since this instrument was completed before any further instructions or tasks).  Some MSQ post test (after manipulations) is available in \code{\link{affect}}.

The EA and TA scales are from Thayer, the PA and NA scales are from Watson et al. (1988).
Scales and items:

Energetic Arousal: Active, Energetic, Vigorous, Wakeful, Wideawake, Full of Pep, Lively, -sleepy, -tired, - drowsy  (ADACL)

Tense Arousal: Intense, Jittery, fearful, tense, clutched up, -quiet, -still, - placid, - calm, -at rest  (ADACL)

Positive Affect: active, excited, strong, inspired, determined, attentive, interested, enthusiastic, proud, alert  (PANAS)

Negative Affect: jittery, nervous, scared, afraid, guilty, ashamed, distressed, upset, hostile, irritable  (PANAS)

The next set of circumplex scales were taken (I think) from Larsen and Diener (1992).  
High activation: active, aroused, surprised, intense, astonished
Activated PA: elated, excited, enthusiastic, lively
Unactivated NA : calm, serene, relaxed, at rest, content, at ease
PA: happy, warmhearted, pleased, cheerful, delighted
Low Activation: quiet, inactive, idle, still, tranquil
Unactivated PA: dull, bored, sluggish, tired, drowsy
NA: sad, blue, unhappy, gloomy, grouchy
Activated NA: jittery, anxious, nervous, fearful, distressed.

Keys for these separate scales are shown in the examples.  

In addition to the MSQ, there are 5 scales from the Eysenck Personality Inventory (Extraversion, Impulsivity, Sociability, Neuroticism, Lie).  The Imp and Soc are subsets of the the total extraversion scale.
