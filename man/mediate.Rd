\title{Estimate and display direct and indirect effects of mediators and  moderator in path models}
\description{
Find the direct and indirect effects of a predictor in path models of mediation and moderation. Bootstrap confidence intervals for the indirect effects.  
}
\usage{
mediate(y, x, m, data, mod = NULL, n.obs = NULL, use = "pairwise", n.iter = 5000, 
       alpha = 0.05, std = FALSE)
mediate.diagram(medi,digits=2,...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{y}{The dependent variable (or a formula suitable for a linear model)}
  \item{x}{The principal Independent Variable}
  \item{m}{One (or more) mediating variables}
  \item{data}{A data frame holding the data or a correlation  matrix. }
  \item{mod}{A moderating variable, if desired}
  \item{n.obs}{If the data are from a correlation or covariance matrix, 
     how many observations were used. This will lead to simulated data for the bootstrap.}
  \item{use}{use="pairwise" is the default when finding correlations or covariances}
  \item{n.iter}{Number of bootstrap resamplings to conduct}
  \item{alpha}{Set the width of the confidence interval to be 1 - alpha}
  \item{std}{standardize the covariances to find the standardized betas}
  \item{digits}{The number of digits to report in the mediate.diagram.} 
  \item{medi}{The output from mediate may be imported into mediate.diagram}
  \item{...}{Additional graphical parameters to pass to mediate.diagram}
}
\details{
When doing linear modeling, it is frequently convenient to estimate the direct effect of a predictor controlling for the indirect effect of a mediator.  See Preacher and Hayes (2004) for a very thorough discussion of mediation.  The mediate function will do some basic mediation and moderation models, with bootstrapped confidence intervals for the mediation/moderation effects. 

In the case of being provided just a correlation matrix, the bootstrapped values are based upon bootstrapping from data matching the original correlation matrix with the addition of normal errors.  This allows us to test the mediation/moderation effect even if not given raw data.

\value{
\item{total}{The total direct effect of x on y  (c)}
\item{direct}{The beta effects of x (c') and m  (b) on y   }
\item{indirect}{The indirect effect of x through m on y (c-ab)}
\item{mean.boot}{mean bootstrapped value of indirect effect}
\item{sd.boot}{Standard deviation of bootstrapped values}
\item{ci.quant}{The upper and lower confidence intervals based upon the quantiles of the bootstrapped distribution.}
\item{boot}{The bootstrapped values themselves.}
\item{a}{The effect of x on m}
\item{b}{The effect of m on y}
\item{b.int}{The interaction of x and mod (if specified)}

\note{Currently just does simple (and parallel) mediation and simple moderation.  The graphics are also fairly limited.  There are a number of other packages that do mediation analysis and they are probably preferred.  This function is supplied for the more basic cases.
